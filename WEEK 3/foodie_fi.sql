							-- C. Challenge Payment Question
-- C1. The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table 
-- with the following requirements:

-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
-- Example outputs for this table might look like the following:

-- customer_id	plan_id	plan_name	payment_date	amount	payment_order

WITH cte1 AS(
	SELECT customer_id, plan_id, start_date, 
	LEAD(start_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_start_date

								-- D. Outside The Box Questions
-- The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, 
-- but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

-- D1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

WITH cte1 AS(
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month, COUNT(*) 
	FROM subscriptions
	GROUP BY year, month
	ORDER BY year, month
),

cte2 AS(
	SELECT *, LAG(count) OVER(ORDER BY year, month)
	FROM cte1
)

SELECT YEAR,
	MONTH,
	COUNT AS CURRENT_NUM_OF_CUST,
	LAG AS PREV_MONTHS_NUM_OF_CUST,
	ROUND(COUNT*100.0 / LAG - 100,
		0) AS PERCENTAGE_GROWTH_FROM_PREV_MONTH
FROM CTE2;


-- D2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

WITH cte1 AS(
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month, COUNT(*) 
	FROM subscriptions
	GROUP BY year, month
	ORDER BY year, month
)

SELECT 
	year, month, count AS current_num_of_cust 
FROM cte1;

-- D3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
WITH cte
AS (
	SELECT
		s.customer_id,
		p.plan_id,
		p.plan_name,
		start_date,
		LEAD(p.plan_id) OVER(
			PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY p.plan_id) plan_n
	FROM subscriptions s
	JOIN plans p
	ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id)

SELECT 
	plan_id,
	COUNT(*) churn_counts
FROM cte
WHERE plan_n = 4
GROUP BY plan_id;



-- D4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
-- What were the trigger(s) that made you cancel?
-- What did you like about the product or service?
-- What didnÂ’t you like about the product or service?
-- What suggestions do you have to improve the product or service?
-- What suggestions do you have to improve the product or service?Would you reconsider our product in the future? What would that take?
-- Who do you think is the ideal customer for our product or service?


-- D5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
-- From the data we have seen ~250 customers have upgraded thier plan to annual one and only ~5-10 customers have opted outfrom the annual plan
-- which is bit positive side, So problem have arised in monthly plan and trial plans,
-- If we talk about monthly plan particulaly pro monthly so there is hardly a price difference between pro monthly to pro annualy so they can 
-- set service pricing to make customers can opt for longer term plan but this is just one aspect but from trial - churn and basic - churn rate
-- we can see customers are lefting subscriptions which is 20% of total, company might need to improve effectiveness of their service and make customers 
-- feel worth of the value that service provides.
-- To talk about measuring effectiveness we could use various metrics such as churn ratio for each plan, customer plan upgradation growth monthly or quaterly.
